npx create-react-app appname
The above command creates the package.json file which has got all the dependencies needed for a react application.

It also creates a few directories ,i.e. the public and src directories and it creates a node_module directory with all the library modules that is implied by the package.json file.
Also in the source(src) directory an App.js file is created and some of the initial code for the App.js component is created.
It create all the skeleton files like App.css,App.test.js,index.js file which is a primary javascript file for the site HTML page which is in the public directory.
The public index.html and the source index.js file work together to make the app available on the browser.
The functions like UseEffect,UseStateand createContext are imported from the react library.
a context is created byusing CreateContext().
The colorcontext.provider returns the value as color .'

Component is a function. Square function throws out which a normal HTML page cannot understand.

react has got the syntax of JSX code , The JSX is converted to normal HTML by react platform.
The square has only one variable tht is color. The color variabble is used to set the 

app.js is the file which keeps all the component together.
 Why the color needs useeffect usestate setinterval (ColorContext.js)?

 style={{
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column",
        alignItems: "center",
        justifyContent: "center",
        width: "300px",
        height: "620px",
        margin: "50px auto",
        borderRadius: "20px",
        border: "2px solid blue",
        overflow: "hidden",
      }}
the first curly braces is for the JSX. For JSX to evaluate the expression we need a curly bracket.

Because we are passing a value in json we need the second curly bracket .
Style is a value that is passed to the JSx.
All the components share the style value as they are in the parent DIV.
purpose of the parent div is to position all the components in the center inside a mobile shape box.


ColorContext is created from the react platform using create context by createContext function.

Colorprovider has got children as props and we are passing different properties.Destructuring of props into children.

ColorContext.provider is the tag return from the colorprovider.
provider is basically taking color as a destructuring props
